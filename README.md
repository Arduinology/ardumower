#Ardumower

##Credits
This is a fork of the Ardumower svn repo found at https://code.google.com/p/ardumower/
Thanks to the original authors Alexander Grau and Sven Gennat


##About
Ardumower aims to simplify your life by allowing an automated lawn mowing process.


##Disclaimer
Use of the Ardumower has not been tested yet on this repo. The Ardumower should not be operated without direct human supervision and is at your own risk.


##Status
This is very much a developer only situation at this time. As time goes on we hope to get an out of the box kit that you can purchase as well as a list of parts/design files so you can hunt for your own deals & customize for your needs.


##Contact me
Questions or interest in the project, I am on twitter [@arduinology](https://twitter.com/arduinology).
